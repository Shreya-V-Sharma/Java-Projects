Sample input:

    2
    1.0 1.0 5.0 5.0
    2.0 2.0 3.0 3.0
    1.0 1.0 5.0 5.0
    2.0 2.0 4.0 4.0

Expected output:

    The first Circle's centre is: 5.0, 5.0
    It's radius is: 4.0

    The second Circle's centre is: 10.0, 2.0
    It's radius is: 3.0

    The 'contains' method returns: false
    The 'touches' method returns: false


    The first Circle's centre is: 4.0, 2.0
    It's radius is: 1.0

    The second Circle's centre is: 2.0, 2.0
    It's radius is: 1.0

    The 'contains' method returns: false
    The 'touches' method returns: true

Actual output(exactly same as above):

    The first Circle's centre is: 5.0, 5.0
    It's radius is: 4.0

    The second Circle's centre is: 10.0, 2.0
    It's radius is: 3.0

    The 'contains' method returns: false
    The 'touches' method returns: false


    The first Circle's centre is: 4.0, 2.0
    It's radius is: 1.0

    The second Circle's centre is: 2.0, 2.0
    It's radius is: 1.0

    The 'contains' method returns: false
    The 'touches' method returns: true


Illustrated cases(from pg.7):

        The output is in the following form

        (contains method result)
        (touches method result)

Expected output:

    1 true
      false

    2 false
      true

    3 true
      false

    4 false
      true

    5 false
      true

    6 false
      false

Actual Output:

    1 true
      false

    2 false
      true

    3 true
      false

    4 false
      true

    5 false
      true

    6 false
      false
