Sample Input:

    2
    1.0 1.0 5.0 5.0
    2.0 2.0 3.0 3.0
    1.0 1.0 5.0 5.0
    2.0 2.0 4.0 4.0

Expected Output:

    The first Rectangle's top corner is: 1.0, 1.0
    It's width is: 5.0
    It's height is: 5.0

    The second Rectangle's top corner is: 2.0, 2.0
    It's width is: 3.0
    It's height is: 3.0

    The contains method returns: true
    The touches method returns: false


    The first Rectangle's top corner is: 1.0, 1.0
    It's width is: 5.0
    It's height is: 5.0

    The second Rectangle's top corner is: 2.0, 2.0
    It's width is: 4.0
    It's height is: 4.0

    The contains method returns: false
    The touches method returns: true


Actual output: (100% same as above)

    The first Rectangle's top corner is: 1.0, 1.0
    It's width is: 5.0
    It's height is: 5.0

    The second Rectangle's top corner is: 2.0, 2.0
    It's width is: 3.0
    It's height is: 3.0

    The contains method returns: true
    The touches method returns: false


    The first Rectangle's top corner is: 1.0, 1.0
    It's width is: 5.0
    It's height is: 5.0

    The second Rectangle's top corner is: 2.0, 2.0
    It's width is: 4.0
    It's height is: 4.0

    The contains method returns: false
    The touches method returns: true


Extra Test cases(from pg.5):

    The output is in the following form

    (contains method result)
    (touches method result)

Expected output:

    1 true
      false

    2 false
      true

    3 true
      false

    4 false
      true

    5 false
      true

    6 false
      true

    7 false
      false

Actual output(same as above):

    1 true
      false

    2 false
      true

    3 true
      false

    4 false
      true

    5 false
      true

    6 false
      true

    7 false
      false


Extra cases:

    8 Testing touches(Rectangle1 r) and containes(Rectangle1 r),same x position (on the line), but y outside of the rectangle
      Ex. rect1 = Rectangle(0,0,2,2)  rect 2 = (2,3,1,1)
      this is not touching and not contained
    9 Testing contains(px,py), touching corner
      not contained
    10 Testing touches(px,py), similar case as 8. same x(on line) but y outside of rectangle
       not touching


    The output is in the following form

    8 (contains method result)
      (touches method result)

    9 (contains method result)

    10 (touches method result)

Expected result:

    8 false
      false

    9 false

    10 false

Actual result(same as above):

    8 false
      false

    9 false

    10 false
