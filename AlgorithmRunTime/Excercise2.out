Input:
5 100 1000 10000 100000 1000000 10000000 0

Output:
5 3 14 0
100 70 327 0

It was taking too long to compile for n values 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, and 10000000, it never finished compiling so didn't output anything
The runtime must have been very high for them.

I will test some points(n) in between to make graph smooth

20 11 54 0
40 35 326 0
60 35 326 0
80 70 327 0
200 140 328 0
300 241 542 0
400 315 550 0
500 315 550 0
600 315 550 0
700 675 909 0
takes too long after n = 700
