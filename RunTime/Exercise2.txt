I get following exception when I try matrix of size around 19000(not 10000 like specified in the lab doucment)

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
	at CSCI2110.Lab3.MatrixMult.matrixMult(MatrixMult.java:37)
	at CSCI2110.Lab3.MatrixMult.main(MatrixMult.java:25)

This exception is thrown when there is not enough space(memory) in Java heap(where objects instantiated by a program are stored) to store a specific
variable/object.This object would be larger than the memory space a available in Java heap. In our program when we make a matrix of size 19000 by 19000,
that would need a lot of memory. Java heap doesn't have this much space, so "OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space" exception is thrown.
